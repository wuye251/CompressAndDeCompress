Live streaming resources pre-packaged service project
Provide prepackaged services for live tutorial topic resources, optimizing the user into the live and live the loading speed, bound by each class hour will be in the courseware resource url list to compression of the packaging service to other business, NMQ asynchronous notification packaging results zipUrl deposited in the database, the user enters live access to download and unpack them zipUrl, optimizing the loading speed.The development USES NMQ, understanding the difference between NMQ and RPC, and the idea of optimization.

Teaching content drawing board development, add, delete, update and other function
Class for teaching teachers to upload, edit, modify courseware resources, for the use of class teacher import courseware, courseware attribute has content, knowledge, citations, changes to the author, source of the author and modify attributes such as time, learn from the project of technology or knowledge of MySQL table query, redis cache, abstract interfaces in your code, coupling, improve reusability.

Other projects: file compression (school practice project) 
Techniques used: data structures: Heap, Huffman Huffman tree, Huffmancode        Project description: use Huffman coding for any file (image, video, audio) project
Idea compression: count the number of characters in the compressed file, construct the Huffman tree with the minimum heap, generate the Huffman code based on the Huffman tree and write it into the new file, the file is compressed.    Decompression: the compressed file Huffman dictionary (struct) is translated into characters, written to a new file, this file is decompression file
